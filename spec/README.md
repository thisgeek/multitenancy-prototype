Specification Testing
=====================
This directory contains all the project tests. You can think if this as the
specifications for how the program is supposed to work, therefore the term
"spec".

Specifications are written for the Jasmine test framework on Node.js.

Have a look at `spec/test-for-smoke.spec.coffee` to see a contrived example
of how easy and expressive the testing spec syntax is.

To run the specifications tests just `cd multitenancy-prototype/` into the project root directory and run

    bin/cake test
